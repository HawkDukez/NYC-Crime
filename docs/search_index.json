The safety of this city is closely related to millions of New Yorkers. In this project, we visualize crime incidents in New York City from 2006 to 2021 from multiple perspectives such as total numbers, crime types, location, genders, and ages. At the same time, we analyze factors that may be related to the crime rate in New York City. As the COVID-19 has had a huge impact on the entire human society, we also explore how the COVID-19 epidemic affects the criminal condition in New York City. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Incident Level Arrest Data - 2006 through most recent full year The NYPD releases a number of incident level datasets related to police enforcement and criminal activity. By utilizing this information, we can analyze the connection among different factors and the trend in 16 year. COVID-19 Daily Counts of Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths This dataset includes daily counts of NYC residents who tested positive, who were hospitalized with COVID-19, and deaths among COVID-19 patients, which can provide us with information about COVID-19 and can be related with data of crime. Mental-Health-Service-Finder-Data This dataset includes the distribution of mental-health-service in NYC, which may be related to the distribution of crime incidents.

Compared to the total data size, the proportion of missing value for all column is small in total, so our dataset has good quality. We may just remove the rows which has missing value when we do the following analysis. In all time periods, LAW_CAT_CD has the highest proportion of missing values. Besides, LAW_CAT_CD, PD_DESC, KY_CD, PD_CD, LAW_CODE and OFNS_DESC often miss together before 2020. After 2020, the pattern changed slightly, LAW_CODE column has no value any more. Maybe we will do further discussion about this. Also we can find the missing pattern in data before 2010: Geographic location information(X_COORD_CD, Y_COORD_CD, Latitude and Longitude and Lon_Lat) tend to miss together. 4.2 DATA-2 COVID-19 Data Insights: This is no missing value in this dataset so that we don’t need to preprocess it. 4.3 DATA-3 Mental Health Data Table 4.2: Missing values column count filter_inpatient_svc 457 filter_residential_pgm 432 filter_military 374 longitude 2 Insights: Firstly, for this dataset, we only focus the mental health center’s basic condition in different areas to find the relation to crime, so we drop some unnecessary columns before we adopt missing value analysis. Secondly, the basic information(such as name/location) of mental health center is complete and have no missing values. Secondly, the basic information(such as name/location) of mental health center is complete and have no missing values. Thirdly, Missing values are mainly concentrated in these three columns: filter_inpatient_svc, filter_residential_pgm and filter_military (above 75%) and most of them are missing together. After reviewing the dataset, we find that missing represent that the flag = 0. So we will fill the missing value by zero and try to explore more information about the mental health center. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Arrest data analysis of NYC from 2006 to 2021 5.2 Covid-19 VS Hate Crime in NYC 5.3 Mental Health Center VS Crime in NYC", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Arrest data analysis of NYC from 2006 to 2021 5.1.1 Total Number of Crimes From the above figure, we can see that from 2006 to 2010, the total number of crimes in New York City has been increasing every year, with the largest increase in 2007 and 2009, at about 25,000. The number of crimes has been declining every year since 2010, with the largest decrease in 2020 of approximately 75,000 compared to 2019. 5.1.2 Time Related Analysis Data fluctuates greatly, which means no big relationship between adjacent days. And the general trend over years is similar to the histogram in 5.1.1. In each facet, the trend of the lines decrease by years in general. And numbers of arrest in weekends is a bit less than in weekdays. In general, crimes in every quarter decrease. Compared different quarters, before 2020 it seems that numbers of arrest in the forth quarter is less than other quarters. While in the second and third quarter in 2020 numbers of arrest decrease greatly and in 2021 increase. The missing of data in the forth quarter in 2020 is due to the delay of the update of the data in NYDP. In general, crimes in every month decrease. Compared different months, before 2020 it seems that numbers of arrest in December is less than other months. While in the mid year of 2020 numbers of arrest decrease greatly and in 2021 increase. 5.1.3 Classification of Crimes In this data set provided by the NYPD, each arrested crime corresponds to two categories, OFNS_DESC and PD_DESC. OFNS_DESC is the description of internal classification which is more general. PD_DESC is the description of internal classification which is more granular than OFNS_DESC. We draw Mosaic chart, line chart and Cleveland dot plot for this two categories. 5.1.3.1 General Category(OFNS_DESC) Due to the large number of types in OFNS_DESC, we only take the 30 most numerous types. We divide the 15-year data into three five-year data and draw a graph to see the changes in the distribution of OFNS_DESC. From the three Cleveland Dot Plots above, we can find that although the total number of crimes has dropped, DANGEROUS DRUGS, ASSAULT 3 are still the two types of most numerous crimes. But the difference between these two types is gradually decreasing. From 2006 to 2010, CRIMINAL TRESPASS was still a serious problem, but after 2010, the number of this crime decreased significantly. It’s worth noting that the third most numerous crime has changed from CRIMINAL TRESPASS to THEFT and then to PETIT LARCENY, which are similar but the severity of the accusation has lessened. Those most numerous crimes are what we should pay attention to, so we take the intersection of the 30 types of the most numerous types from each year, and obtain 6 OFNS_DESC, which are ASSAULT 3, DANGEROUS DRUGS, DANGEROUS WEAPONS, FELONY ASSAULT, MISCELLANEOUS PENAL LAW and ROBBERY. From this line chart, we can find that DANGEROUS DRUGS is the most numerous type from 2006 to 2017. At the most, it’s almost three times the second highest crime , ASSAULT 3. But its number has been declining, until 2018 it is less than ASSAULT 3. And until 2020, it becomes less than FELONY ASSAULT. The number of ASSAULT 3 is around 30000. It gradually decreases after 2019. After 2018, it has become the most numerous crime type. The numbers of the other four types of crimes are all declining since 2006. From the Mosaic chart, we can see that the proportion of DANGEROUS DRUGS is constantly decreasing, the proportion of ASSAULT 3 is constantly increasing, and the proportion of the sum of them in the total is decreasing. 5.1.3.2 Granular Category(PD_DESC) Similar to the OFNS_DESC, we also only take the 30 most numerous types in PD_DESC and divide the 15-year data into three five-year data. From the three Cleveland Dot Plots above, we can find that MARIJUANA POSSESSION has been most numerous crimes in 2006 to 2010 and 2011 to 2015. Similarly, CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE is also a problem during these two period. But from 2016 to 2020, the number of these two crimes has decreased. TRAFFIC also decrease after 2010. THEFT was serious during 2011 to 2015, but the situation has improved after 2015. Although it has decreased, the number of ASSAULT 3 is still high, and it has become the most numerous type of crime in the period of 2016 to 2020. We take the intersection of the 30 types of the most numerous types from each year. Unlike OFNS_DESC, we obtain 7 PD_DESC in common. The number of MARIJUANA POSSESSION has been greatly decreased after 2015, even fall out of top. Hence, it is not in the result of intersection. Among the remaining crimes, ASSAULT 3 has always been the most numerous type. After 2018, its number has decreased drastically. Other types of crime are also gradually decreasing from 2006. From the Mosaic chart, we can see that although the number of ASSAULT 3 is decreasing, as the total number is also decreasing, the proportion of ASSAULT 3 has increased slightly. 5.1.4 Level of Offense In this data set of arrest crimes in New York City, each crime corresponds one level of offense, including F(Felony), I(Infraction), M(Misdemeanor), and V(Violation). From this line chart, we can find that The number of Misdemeanor has decreased significantly since 2010. The number of Infraction has always been a small percentage of all crimes, and since it has no significant impact on society, we did not draw a separate graph of it. Felony and Violation also gradually decrease. The number and proportion of Felony have an important impact on social security and should be of concern to us. We find that although the total number of crimes is decreasing, the proportion of felony crimes is increasing, which shows that the improvement of felony crimes has not played an important role in the reduction of the total number. 5.1.5 Jurisdiction Code Table 5.1: JURISDICTION_CODE of NYC-Crime JURISDICTION_CODE count percentage 0 4393704 83.3930701 1 462933 8.7865282 2 272560 5.1732240 other 139461 2.6469878 NA 10 0.0001898 JURISDICTION_CODE responsibles for arrest. Jurisdiction codes 0(Patrol), 1(Transit) and 2(Housing) represent NYPD while other represents non NYPD jurisdictions. From the histogram, we can see majority of the criminals were arrested by Patrol. From the left graph, we conclude that the proportion of JURISDICTION_CODE 0 which means ‘patrol’ increases over years, while JURISDICTION_CODE 1 which means Transit decreases these years. From the right graph, generally number of each type of JURISDICTION_CODE except type ‘other’ decreases over years and numbers of JURISDICTION_CODE 0 which means Patrol decreases sharply since 2014. 5.1.6 Age Group Table 5.2: JURISDICTION_CODE of NYC-Crime AGE_GROUP count percentage &lt;18 421539 8.0008799 18-24 1368110 25.9669540 25-44 2459592 46.6834628 45-64 973760 18.4821258 65+ 45462 0.8628763 unknown 178 0.0033785 NA 17 0.0003227 The majority of criminals’ AGE_GROUP is 25-44, followed by 18-24,45-64,&lt;18, while the minority is 65+. This is rational as the olds and underages are less stronger and they are less likely to commit crime. From the left graph, we conclude that the proportion of &lt;18 decreases over years, while criminals between 25-44 increases. From the right graph, generally number of criminal in each age_group except 65+ decreases over years. As for &lt;18,18-24,25-44, each decreases significantly since 2014, while 45-64 decreases since 2010 smoothly. 5.1.7 Category of Sex Table 5.3: JURISDICTION_CODE of NYC-Crime PERP_SEX count percentage F 884283 16.78446 M 4384180 83.21554 Numbers of male is about four times bigger than female. According to some research, due to physiological factors (primitive gender differences), Male and female body structures are different, and naturally there will be some differences in various aspects. In terms of endocrine, men will have more eandrogens, which makes men stronger and more aggressive.Women have more estrogen in their bodies, making them less aggressive than men. Of course, because women are generally less physically powerful than men, they are more difficult to commit crimes, which will also affect the crime rate. From the left graph, the proportion of PREP_SEX seems to have no big difference over years. From the right graph, generally numbers of criminal in both categories decrease since 2014, while the trend of female is more smooth than male. 5.1.8 Comprehensive analysis From the mosaic, it seems that the proportion of female criminals in the under-ages is greater than adults. This maybe because the primitive gender differences are not so big in under-ages than in adults. As the classfication of OFNS_DESC is a bit trivial, We combine some categories of OFNS_DESC, such as combine different kinds of assualt into new type ASSAULT, different kinds of larceny into Larceny. We select several popular types that we have shown in 5.1.3 to make mosaic plot. From the mosaic, it seems that in general the differences of proportion of different types(except BURGLARY) between each PREP_SEX decrease as AGE_GROUP increase. The proportion of ASSAULT as well as LARCENY is bigger in female compared to male obviously, while proportion of Drug as well as Weapon is bigger in male. We make an interactive graph including ARREST_BORO，AGE_GROUP, PREP_SEX, type to gain more information about crimes in NYC after 2020. The color identify different sex. 1.Outliers: Considering AGE_GROUP, 25-44 is higher than other ages consistent to the results in 5.1.6. Considering ARREST_BORO, the numbers of crimes of each category in Staten Island is less than other boroughs obviously. Queens has highest number in Sex Crime, followed by Kings, Brooklyn; Brooklyn has highest number in Rape, followed by Kings and Queens; Kings has highest number in Weapon; Manhattan has large number in Larceny, Robbery, Burglary and Drug; Both Kings and Brooklyn has large number in Drug, Assault, Robbery and Murder. 2.Clusters: In general, the number of criminals in male is bigger than female, consistent to the result in 5.1.7. 3.Correlation：Note if the lines between two categories twist, then we consider the categories have negative correlation, otherwise positive. By changing the order of the categories in the interactive graph, we seem to find no evidence to convince there exists obvious twist(negative correlation) between any two category. Maybe if one kind of crimes occurs frequently, it means the borough is not safe maybe due to poor public security there, thus other kinds of crimes is unlikely to occur less. 5.1.9 Crime Geographical Analysis In our dataset, there are some columns includes information about geographic information: ARREST_BORO: Borough of arres. There are five boroughs in NYC: B(Bronx), S(Staten Island), K(Brooklyn), M(Manhattan), Q(Queens) ARREST_PRECINCT: Precinct where the arrest occurred Latitude + Longitude : coordinates for Global Coordinate System 5.1.9.1 Borough Level Analysis From the pie chart, we can know that the area with the most crime is Brooklyn, and Staten Island has least crime numbers. Besides, we draw mosaic maps reflecting the proportion of crimes in different regions in over years. We found that the proportion of crime in Queens and Staten Island is increasing, especially after 2015. 5.1.9.2 Precinct Level Analysis alt text here From the histograms of boroughs and the precinct map in NYC, we can see the different pattern of crimes on different police precincts. In Manhattan, crime number of each precincts are relatively even (except for precinct 14), howeverr, Bronx has a distrubition with higher variance. Also, we can We pick out the top 20 precincts with the most criminal records and found that 9 of them (almost 50%) are in Bronx, which is the most among 5 boroughs. 5.1.9.3 NYC crime maps Comparing the drug crime situation in 2018 and 2020, we can find the following two points: From 2018 to 2021, dangerous drug crimes have decreased a lot. Drug crimes are clustered on the map, we can find that the southern part of Bronx is an area with more serious drug crimes. From this two plot, we can find that larceny crimes are concentrated on the midtown and downtown, which around the central park. From 2018 to 2020, the larceny crimes on Manhattan decrease a lot however the number of PETIT LARCENY in other areas has no big difference. 5.2 Covid-19 VS Hate Crime in NYC 5.2.1 Time Series Analysis of Covid-19 Case count is greater than the other two. The first peak occurs around April 2020, the second peak occurs around the February 2021 maybe related to the cold temperature, then it decrease maybe due to the use of vaccine, while the third peak which maybe related to Delta occurs around September 2021. The hospitalized count and death count is quite less than case count. Considering the rate, we conclude as first both death rate and hospitalized rate are high and then decrease in general. 5.2.2 Hate Crime Analysis Combining numbers of hate crimes with Covid-19 cases, it seems to have a positive relationship after Feburary 2021. The trend of numbers of hate crime is lagging behind the trend of numbers of Covid-19 cases by about 2 months at first. The numbers of hate crimes increase greatly as Covid-19 cases increase greatly after Feburary 2021, then it decrease greatly as Covid-19 cases decrease greatly, then it bounce a little as the Covid-19 cases increase a bit, then it decrease greatly as Covid-19 cases decrease since Semptember 2021. 5.2.2.1 General Category(Offense Category) In total, numbers of Religion/Religious Practice hate crimes is highest, followed by Race/Color, Sex Orientation. The rank of numbers of different offense category does not change much over years, except for Gender moves up by one position on 2020. In 2020, numbers of Religion/Religious Practice as well as Sex Orientation hate crimes decrease greatly than(about half) than 2019, while Race/Color increase a bit. In 2021, the top three categories of hate crimes all increase, especially for Race/Color which increase by almost one time. The numbers of hate crimes of category Religion/Religious Practice, Race/Color and Sexual Orientation increase greatly around the start of 2021, maybe has some relationship with Covid-19. 5.2.2.2 Granular Category(Bias Type) Considering types in Race/Color hate crimes, ANTI-ASIAN has a peak in the start of 2020, and another peak occurs around the first half of the year and then decrease. Considering types in Religion/Religious Practice hate crimes, the majority is ANTI-JEWISH hate crime whose number decreases since the start of 2020 but then increase greatly on the start of 2021. Considering types in Sexual Orientation hate crimes, the majority is ANTI-MALE HOMOSEXUAL(GAY) hate crime whose number increases greatly since March 2021. There is almost none ANTI-FEMALEHOMOSEXUAL(LESBIAN) as well as ANTI_LGBT(MIXED GROUP) hate crimes in 2021. 5.2.2.3 County Level Analysis In total, numbers of hate crimes in New York county ranks first, followed by Kings, while Richmond has the least number of hate crime, followed by BRONX. In generally, number of hate crimes in each county increases since Feb 2021, then decreases after May 2021. And New York increases the most and reaches the highest number on May 2021. We make an interactive graph including County，Year, Bias type to gain more information about hate crimes in NYC in recent 3 years. The color identify different year. In 2021, New York county has the largest number of hate crimes in both ANTI-GAY and ANTI-ASIAN obviously, Queens has the largest number in ANTI-MUSLIM. You can find more interested information by yourself. 5.3 Mental Health Center VS Crime in NYC Here we have the data about the distribution of mental-health-service in NYC, so we want to explore if mental health center is related to the crime distribution, or is there any advice about mental health center construction that we can come up with. 5.3.1 Mental Health Center in Boroughs Table 5.4: Mental Service Center Counts in NYC Borough n B 86 K 113 M 172 Q 85 S 31 NA 5 This is a scatter plot between Mental Health Service Finder Count VS Crime Count. Even if we just have 5 borough, we can find there is a rough positive relation between two counts. It means that now there are more mental health centers in boroughs with more crimes. Manhattan has relatively more mental centers and Brooklyn &amp; Bronx can build more Mental Health Center. 5.3.2 Geographical Analysis According to some scientific researches, drug use and gun crime are related to mental health to a certain extent. So we explore the geographic distribution of these two crimes and compared them with the distribution of mental health centers. From these for maps, we can find that the location of the mental health center is very consistent with the distribution of drug crime and weapon crime’s sites, which reflects that New York’s mental health construction is very complete and supportive. Besides, there is still room for improvement such as adding mental health service center in Rockway Beach and the area around EAST NEW YORK in Brooklyn. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 New York City Precinct Map of Crimes in 2020", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 New York City Precinct Map of Crimes in 2020 This map contains hate crimes data of different precincts in New York City in 2020. In this interactive map, you can see 8 kinds of statistics, “TOTAL”, “ASSAULT”, “DRUGS”, “WEAPONS”, “FELONY”, “MPL”, “ROBBERY” and “HATE”. When mousing over the region of this precinct, these statistics of specific precinct will show up to help you quickly know the safety situation in this area. As discussed in 5.1.3, we found 6 most numerous crimes from 2006 to 2021. In this map, ASSAULT denotes ASSAULT 3 &amp; RELATED OFFENSES. DRUGS denotes DANGEROUS DRUGS. WEAPONS denotes DANGEROUS WEAPONS. FELONY denotes FELONY ASSAULT. MPL denotes MISCELLANEOUS PENAL LAW. ROBBERY denotes ROBBERY. HATE denotes the number of hate crimes cases in NYPD_Hate_Crimes.csv. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion In our project, we comprehensively analyze and visualize crime incidents in New York City from 2013 to 2021 from multiple perspectives such as magnitude, time, type, age, sex, position and so on. Besides, we also try to explore the connection between crime and other social factors such as COVID-19 VS hate crimes and Mental Health Service VS Drugs&amp;Gun Crimes. Here are some conclusions and further suggestions: In terms of the overall crime situation in New York, the total number of crimes in New York City has been declining sharply every year from 2011-2021. Among all types, the proportion of DANGEROUS DRUGS is constantly decreasing, the proportion of ASSAULT 3 is constantly increasing. Among 5 boroughs, proportion of crime in Queens and Staten Island is increasing especially after 2015 so we should pay more attention on it. Besides, as for covid-19, What’s more, as for mental health services, health centers are positively correlated with the number of crimes in borough level and the location of the mental health center is very consistent with the distribution of drug crime and weapon crime’s sites on map views. We can conclude NYC’s mental health construction is now quite complete and supportive but we can add some mental health service centers in Rockaway Beach and the area around EAST NEW YORK in Brooklyn according to the crime situation.
