The safety of this city is closely related to millions of New Yorkers. In this project, we visualize crime incidents in New York City from 2013 to 2021 from multiple perspectives such as total numbers, crime types, location, genders, and ages. At the same time, we analyze factors that may be related to the crime rate in New York City. As the COVID-19 has had a huge impact on the entire human society, we also explore how the COVID-19 epidemic affects the criminal condition in New York City. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Incident Level Arrest Data - 2013 through most recent full year The NYPD releases a number of incident level datasets related to police enforcement and criminal activity. By utilizing this information, we can analyze the connection among different factors and the trend in 8 year. COVID-19 Daily Counts of Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths This dataset includes daily counts of NYC residents who tested positive, who were hospitalized with COVID-19, and deaths among COVID-19 patients, which can provide us with information about COVID-19 and can be related with data of crime. Mental-Health-Service-Finder-Data This dataset includes the distribution of mental-health-service in NYC, which may be related to the distribution of crime incidents.

Compared to the total data size, the proportion of missing value for all column is small in total, so our dataset has good quality. We may just remove the rows which has missing value when we do the following analysis. In all time periods, LAW_CAT_CD has the highest proportion of missing values. Besides, LAW_CAT_CD, PD_DESC, KY_CD, PD_CD, LAW_CODE and OFNS_DESC often miss together before 2020. After 2020, the pattern changed slightly, LAW_CODE column has no value any more. Maybe we will do further discussion about this. Also we can find the missing pattern in data before 2010: Geographic location information(X_COORD_CD, Y_COORD_CD, Latitude and Longitude and Lon_Lat) tend to miss together. 4.2 DATA-2 COVID-19 Data covid &lt;- read.csv(&quot;COVID-19_Daily_Counts_of_Cases__Hospitalizations__and_Deaths.csv&quot;) library(extracat) #visna(tidycovid, sort = &quot;b&quot;) #visna does not take data without missing value plot_missing(covid, percent = TRUE,angle=90,hjust=1,title=&#39;Missing patterns for COVID_19 Data in NYC&#39;) Insights: This is no missing value in this dataset so that we don’t need to preprocess it. 4.3 DATA-3 Mental Health Data mental &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Mental_Health_Service_Finder_Data.csv&quot;) mental &lt;- select(mental,-contains(&quot;flag&quot;)) library(extracat) visna(mental, sort = &quot;b&quot;) plot_missing(mental, percent = TRUE,angle=90,hjust=1,title=&#39;Missing patterns for Mental Health Data in NYC&#39;) Insights: Firstly, for this dataset, we only focus the mental health center’s basic condition in different areas to find the relation to crime, so we drop some unnecessary columns before we adopt missing value analysis. Secondly, the basic information(such as name/location) of mental health center is complete and have no missing values. Secondly, the basic information(such as name/location) of mental health center is complete and have no missing values. Thirdly, Missing values are mainly concentrated in these three columns: filter_inpatient_svc, filter_residential_pgm and filter_military (above 75%) and most of them are missing together. After reviewing the dataset, we find that missing represent that the flag = 0. So we will fill the missing value by zero and try to explore more information about the mental health center.
