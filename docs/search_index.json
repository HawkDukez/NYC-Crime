The safety of this city is closely related to millions of New Yorkers. In this project, we visualize crime incidents in New York City from 2006 to 2021 from multiple perspectives such as total numbers, crime types, location, genders, and ages. At the same time, we analyze factors that may be related to the crime rate in New York City. As the COVID-19 has had a huge impact on the entire human society, we also explore how the COVID-19 epidemic affects the criminal condition in New York City. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Incident Level Arrest Data - 2006 through most recent full year The NYPD releases a number of incident level datasets related to police enforcement and criminal activity. By utilizing this information, we can analyze the connection among different factors and the trend in 16 year. COVID-19 Daily Counts of Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths This dataset includes daily counts of NYC residents who tested positive, who were hospitalized with COVID-19, and deaths among COVID-19 patients, which can provide us with information about COVID-19 and can be related with data of crime. Mental-Health-Service-Finder-Data This dataset includes the distribution of mental-health-service in NYC, which may be related to the distribution of crime incidents.

Compared to the total data size, the proportion of missing value for all column is small in total, so our dataset has good quality. We may just remove the rows which has missing value when we do the following analysis. In all time periods, LAW_CAT_CD has the highest proportion of missing values. Besides, LAW_CAT_CD, PD_DESC, KY_CD, PD_CD, LAW_CODE and OFNS_DESC often miss together before 2020. After 2020, the pattern changed slightly, LAW_CODE column has no value any more. Maybe we will do further discussion about this. Also we can find the missing pattern in data before 2010: Geographic location information(X_COORD_CD, Y_COORD_CD, Latitude and Longitude and Lon_Lat) tend to miss together. 4.2 DATA-2 COVID-19 Data Insights: This is no missing value in this dataset so that we don’t need to preprocess it. 4.3 DATA-3 Mental Health Data Insights: Firstly, for this dataset, we only focus the mental health center’s basic condition in different areas to find the relation to crime, so we drop some unnecessary columns before we adopt missing value analysis. Secondly, the basic information(such as name/location) of mental health center is complete and have no missing values. Secondly, the basic information(such as name/location) of mental health center is complete and have no missing values. Thirdly, Missing values are mainly concentrated in these three columns: filter_inpatient_svc, filter_residential_pgm and filter_military (above 75%) and most of them are missing together. After reviewing the dataset, we find that missing represent that the flag = 0. So we will fill the missing value by zero and try to explore more information about the mental health center.

Jurisdiction codes 0(Patrol), 1(Transit) and 2(Housing) represent NYPD while other represents non NYPD jurisdictions. From the histogram, we can see majority of the criminals were arrested by Patrol. From the left graph, we conclude that the proportion of JURISDICTin recent 5 yearsION_CODE 0 which means ‘patrol’ increases over years, while JURISDICTION_CODE 1 which means ‘Transit’ decreases these years. From the right graph, generally number of each type of JURISDICTIOn_CODE except type ‘other’ decreases over years and numbers of JURISDICTION_CODE 0 which means ‘patrol’ decreases sharply since 2014. 6.2.4 General Category(AGE_GROUP) Table 6.3: JURISDICTION_CODE of NYC-Crime AGE_GROUP count percentage &lt;18 421539 8.0008799 18-24 1368110 25.9669540 25-44 2459592 46.6834628 45-64 973760 18.4821258 65+ 45462 0.8628763 unknown 178 0.0033785 NA 17 0.0003227 The majority of criminals’ age_group is 25-44, followed by 18-24,45-64,&lt;18, while the minority is 65+. This is rational as the olds and underages are less stronger and they are less likely to commit crime. From the left graph, we conclude that the proportion of criminals younger than 18 decreases over years, while criminals between 25-44 increases. From the right graph, generally number of criminal in each age_group except ‘65+’ decreases over years. As for ‘&lt;18’,‘18-24’,‘25-44’, each decreases significantly since 2014, while ‘45-64’ decreases since 2010 smoothly. 6.2.5 General Category(PERP_SEX) Table 6.4: JURISDICTION_CODE of NYC-Crime PERP_SEX count percentage F 884283 16.78446 M 4384180 83.21554 Numbers of male is about four times bigger than female. According to some research, due to physiological factors (primitive gender differences), Male and female body structures are different, and naturally there will be some differences in various aspects. In terms of endocrine, men will have more eandrogens, which makes men stronger and more aggressive.Women have more estrogen in their bodies, making them less aggressive than men. Of course, because women are generally less physically powerful than men, they are more difficult to commit crimes, which will also affect the crime rate. From the left graph, the proportion of sex seems to have no big difference over years. From the right graph, generally numbers of criminal in both sex decrease since 2014, while the trend of female is more smooth than male. 6.2.6 Comprehensive analysis of catagories From the mosaic, it seems that the proportion of female criminals in the under-ages is greater than adults. This maybe because the primitive gender differences are not so big in under-ages than in adults. 6.3 Crime Geographical Analysis In our dataset, there are some columns includes information about geographic information: ARREST_BORO: Borough of arres. There are five boroughs in NYC: B(Bronx), S(Staten Island), K(Brooklyn), M(Manhattan), Q(Queens) ARREST_PRECINCT: Precinct where the arrest occurred Latitude + Longitude : coordinates for Global Coordinate System 6.3.1 Borough Level Analysis From the pie chart, we can know that the area with the most crime is Brooklyn, and Staten Island has least crime numbers. Besides, we draw mosaic maps reflecting the proportion of crimes in different regions in over years. We found that the proportion of crime in Queens and Staten Island is increasing, especially after 2015. 6.3.2 Precinct Level Analysis \\ alt text here From the histogram of boroughs and precinct map in NYC, we can find that crime will be concentrated in a few adjacent precinct especially in Bronx and Queens. For example, crime is concentrated in areas 40-52 in queens, which is. This performance not only accords with geographical continuity, but also provides reasonable suggestions for arranging police force in the future. We pick out the top 20 precincts with the most criminal records and found that 9 of them (almost 50%) are in Bronx, which is the most among 5 boroughs. 6.3.3 NYC crime maps Comparing the drug crime situation in 2018 and 2020, we can find the following two points: From 2018 to 2021, dangerous drug crimes have decreased a lot. Drug crimes are clustered on the map, we can find that the southern part of Bronx is an area with more serious drug crimes. From this two plot, we can find that larceny crimes are concentrated on the midtown and downtown, which around the central park. From 2018 to 2020, the larceny crimes on Manhattan decrease a lot however the number of PETIT LARCENY in other areas has no big difference.
